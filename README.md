# Contact Form with Validation

## Description
This project is a simple contact form with client-side validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes fields for user input such as first name, last name, email, phone number, address, city, county, zip code, website, hosting, and project description.

## Features
- **Form Fields**: Collects user information with various input types including text, email, radio buttons, and textarea.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the user inputs are in the correct format before submission.
- **Bootstrap Framework**: Utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design and styling components.
- **jQuery**: Implements jQuery for form validation and dynamic content manipulation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the form.
3. No additional setup is required as the form uses CDN links for Bootstrap and jQuery.

## Usage
Fill in the form fields and click the submit button. If any field is incorrectly filled, the form will display an error message prompting the user to correct the input.
